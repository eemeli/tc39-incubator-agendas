## Agenda items
### `Function` helper functions
- General definition (helper functions that would go in the `Function` constructor or maybe other built-in constructors – usually create callbacks, i.e., usually higher-level functions / metafunctions)
- Background from [proposal-function-helpers](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-function-helpers)’s 2021-10 rejection (see [summary of rejection](https://github.com/tc39-transfer/proposal-function-helpers/issues/17#issuecomment-953814353) and its [plenary notes](https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/meetings/2021-10/oct-28.md#function-helpers))
- Review of specific examples from proposal-function-helpers: `flow`, `pipe`, `constant`, `identity`, `noop`, `once`, `aside`, `throttle`, `debounce`
- General approach, criteria, and limits to inclusion of helper functions in core language
- Classification of individual helper functions: which, if any, are worth pursuing next as separated proposals (JSC’s current plan is to tackle flow and pipe functions first as non-controversial adjuncts to the [pipe operator]())
